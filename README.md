# @tscircuit/react-fiber

This is an internal module, you probably want [tscircuit](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit)

This is the layer that binds circuit element `tsx` tags to [@tscircuit/builder](https://github.com/tscircuit/builder)

If you're looking to update types for a circuit element, this is the right repo, look for `intrinsic-jsx.ts`

This module is mostly invisible, you probably want to use the [tscircuit](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit) instead
